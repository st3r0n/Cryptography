used for symmetric key cryptography
use pseudorandom sequences with bits of plaintext to ecrypt they usually XOR it

one time pad--> plain text xored with seudo random stream cipher is based on it


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TYpes of stream cipher
1.syncronous --> when key is completely random not related to the plaintext


2. self-synchronous or asynchronous


it uses previous n block for encryption eg--> CFB

stream cipher vulns-->

key reuse --> eg if c1 and c2 are xoed with k
then c1 xor c2= p1 xor p2 which can be found using frequencey analysis
